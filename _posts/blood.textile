The lyrical content of this song is understated. Often overwhelmed by instrumentation that seems to simply make sense. Voice seems like another part of the orchestra. This deception means the lyrics are easy to miss. The listener is in no way obliged to understand every word to enjoy the song, but something special happens when they do.

Let's look at the final verse. It is possibly my favorite verse of every song I've heard. The orchestration could not be more perfect:

"Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die"

Straight outta the Tibetan Book of the dead. It's a common archetype to 'have your life flash before your eyes'

"Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to Die
And someday soon
You will die" 

"It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread
And it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now"

At this moment the song builds into the penultimate chanting outro. The type that is really appealing to the people who find music for indie movie trailers, which is the most likely place you've heard this song before.
